# whats-new-in-tidyverse-2023

Source code and supplementary materials for "What's new in the tidyverse?" talk for SSA Vic + R-Ladies Melbourne talk on May 30, 2023.

## Abstract

**What's new in the tidyverse?**

The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. One important feature of the tidyverse is that packages in the tidyverse share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. Another important feature is that the tidyverse is a living, breathing, and evolving ecosystem. In this talk I will discuss what is new in the tidyverse, highlighting tips and tricks for what's new in the tidyverse in 2023. Additionally, I will take a broader view of "new" and discuss major updates and new features in the tidyverse that got implemented between the 1st and 2nd editions of R for Data Science.
